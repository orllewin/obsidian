Trip to Cumbria for 4 days, usual chaos setting off. Incident on motorway led to detour taking the A6 over Shap Fell, I never knew it was so vast and beautiful, one to explore properly in the future. Vague memories of going that route up to Scotland 40 years ago.

In Helton now, P asleep (in the shade) in the car, A playing in the paddling pool Nanna and Grandad have set up for our arrival. 

It's very hot, 30 degrees, Wilma (the dog) is panting non-stop so I've come into the cooler house for a while to see if she'll settle down. The combination of a 15 year old black labrador and 30 degree heat does limit what we can do for the 4 days we're here. She'd be best relaxing in the cool house but she's developed separation anxiety when anywhere but at home (like lots of dogs have following the pandemic lockdowns).
