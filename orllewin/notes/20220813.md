Grandparents looked after the kids in the AM so me and S had some rare time together alone, we headed to Carhullan to walk up the [[Cawdale]] clough as far as an old mine with various old derelict buildings and a nice large cave. S had a couple of dips in the Cawdale on the way back. A coffee at Bampton before saving the inlaws from the kids, stopped off to take a photo of the bus stop and telephone box that features in Withnail and I:

Afternoon S took kids to Askham for a walk through Heining Bank woods and back along the River Lowther. Inlaws headed out so I stayed home at Chapel Yat with Wilma; it's far too hot to take her out walking (so here I am updating this journal)
