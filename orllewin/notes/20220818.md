Last few days largely involved childcare and using this time off between jobs to sort out the messy attic. A helped me fit water butts to the front and rear downpipes to collect rain water for watering the garden, it'll mean we can keep watering the garden next time we have a heatwave and is also recommended to help [Slow the Flow](https://slowtheflow.net/).
