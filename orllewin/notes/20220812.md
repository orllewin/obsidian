I was already tired after a busy few days but I didn't sleep well last night. A was acting up at bedtime (well, all day too), refused to do the normal bedtime routine, so she was up in the night for the toilet. Then I was plagued by bad dreams when I finally did nod off.

Today is going to be hot again, 27 degrees. 

Morning trip to Morland, breakfast at the Mill Yard Cafe, then wandering around Morland House gardens, and St Lawrence church which has a Saxon tower.

Afternoon dropped A and S at Rheged for some crafting, while me and P headed in search of the [[Sewborwens]] stone near Greystoke.
