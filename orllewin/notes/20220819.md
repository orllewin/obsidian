S and A are having a 'mummy daughter' day, they've headed to Liverpool on the train, so I took P to Clitheroe to see the castle. When we got there the cafe was permanently closed, and the museum wasn't open yet so we just had a wander around the small keep and town. Clitheroe wasn't entirely inspiring but the drive over Sabden and the lower part of Pendle Hill was nice.
