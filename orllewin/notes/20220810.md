Obsidian daily notes, a journal, who knows. I'm mid-way through a period of time off between jobs. Taking a day off from doing anything at all, hiding in the house during another heat wave, both children in nursery/holiday club and wife S away in the office.

Watching old DVDs and wondering if it's worth getting a Blu Ray player, but that's more uneccessary consumerism, the TV is old too so a Blu Ray would lead to a new TV, and inevitably a sound system of some sort. 

Our internet is over cellular and very slow so streaming in HD doesn't usually work well. We (the hamlet we live in) have signed up for community fibre ([this I think](https://www.openreach.com/fibre-broadband/fibre-community-partnership)), but that may not be in place for another year yet.
