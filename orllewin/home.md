## Software Projects
These are software projects, but hopefully they'll make up a smaller and smaller percentage of the content in this repo. Due to my dayjob there's lots of Android, but also some web, and [[playdate]] projects.
* [[coracle]] is a cross-platform sketch playground written in Kotlin, mainly targeting the web and Android.
* [[radio]] is a simple netradio app, used as a [Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) project for various platforms.
* [[daydream]] is an experiment reverse engineering the old Android VR controller.
