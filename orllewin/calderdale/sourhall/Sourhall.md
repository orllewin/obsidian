## Home

We live in a small hamlet called Sourhall which is in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Our house is a small terrace in what used to be a mill, and then a [smallpox isolation hospital](https://sites.rootsweb.com/~todmordenandwalsden/sourhallhospital.htm), before being converted to 6 houses (quite poorly) In the 1980s.

## Water

Our water comes from a brick tank buried in Todmorden Moor, we added a filter in 2017 when S was pregnant with A, a good addition now rain water is considered [unsafe to drink globally](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7gban/rainwater-everywhere-now-considered-too-toxic-for-safe-consumption-study-finds). The overflow from our tank feeds two large black plastic tanks downstream for our neighbours at Ridge House and also in the converted pub next to us.

In August 2022 the water level in the tank was very low, prompting us to conserve water by not taking baths and flushing less. Ridge House had run out entirely and was bringing water to their property in large tanks on a trailer.
