A there-and-back walk following Cawdale Beck which runs along the bottom of a glacial valley, as far as the old mines (marked on the OS map as 'Tips (dis)'). We parked on the common in front of Moorahill Farm ([OS Grid Ref: NY 49377 18193](https://explore.osmaps.com/?lat=54.556438&lon=-2.784259&zoom=15.5721)), up through Carhullan, then followed the path that runs alongside Cawdale Beck.

On the way back S found a couple of pools in Cawdale Beck for a quick dip to cool off:
