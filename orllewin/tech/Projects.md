Various software projects, but hopefully they'll make up a smaller and smaller percentage of the content in this Obsidian vault. Due to my dayjob there's lots of Android, but also some web, and [[Playdate]] projects.
* [[Water Tank Level]] An ultrasonic sensor in our water tank on the moor
* [[Coracle]] is a cross-platform sketch playground written in Kotlin, mainly targeting the web and Android.
* [[Radio]] is a simple netradio app, used as a [Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) project for various platforms.
* [[Daydream]] is an experiment reverse engineering the old Android VR controller.
